## Different versions
We use the Free and Pro model where users need only one package for using the specific plugin.

### Free

Our free plugins are available in the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org).

Those plugins are fully functional and are not broken versions designed to sell the Pro upgrade.  

### Pro

The Pro plugins are available to PublishPress members and can be downloaded from [PublishPress.com](https://publishpress.com).

Pro plugins are a complement for the Free plugins, with additional features.
We add the Free plugin inside the Pro package and use it as the base for the Pro version.
It can be found in the [Composer's vendor dir]({% link docs/development/dependency-management.md %}).
