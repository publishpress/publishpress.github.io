## Project Management

We use GitHub organization projects as our project management tool.

## Bug and Feature Request Tracking

Features requests and bugs are managed as Github issues.
Both Free and Pro plugins use the Issues on the Free repositories.

### Labels

* `confirmed bug`: The reporter has tested and confirmed on more than 1 site.
* `unconfirmed bug`: This needs more testing. Can often be used when a member of the public posts.
* `discussion needed`: We don't yet know the correct path forward. Please give opinions (edited).
* `feature request`: This has been requested by a customer or one of our team planned feature We have discussed this feature and agreed to build it.

 Additional labels we could use: `design`, `libraries` , `security` , `user interface` , `firefox`, `php8`, etc.
