## Different Versions
We publish plugins in two versions:

* Free - available in the WordPress.org
* Pro - available on our site for members

The Free versions are fully functional and are not broken versions designed to sell the Pro upgrade.

We use the Free plugins as base for the Pro plugins, adding them using Composer, so they become a [dependency added to the vendor library](/docs/deployment/dependency-management).
