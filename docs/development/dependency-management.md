## Dependencies on PHP

We use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as dependency manager for any 3rd party library or even the [Free plugin in the Pro plugin]({% link docs/free-pro.md %}).

## Dependencies on JavaScript

For the JS dependencies, usually for development tools onl, we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
