## The release window

Releases should only happen between Monday and Thursday. We donâ€™t want to disrupt the weekends for customers or our staff.
The only exception to this release schedule is in case of an absolute emergency.

Before releasing, please make sure you still have a few hours available before leaving. It is good to be around in case
anything goes really wrong.

## How to release

Every release on PublishPress is mostly a manual process, so in order to avoid mistakes we do advise following a checklist on every release.
A good practice is to add a Github issue template on every Free plugin repository, according to the examples below:

### Template for the checklists

Save the [free plugin's checklist template file](../../examples/release-free-plugin.md.dist) at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-free-plugin.md`.
Save the [pro plugin's checklist template file](../../examples/release-pro-plugin.md.dist) at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-pro-plugin.md`.
