# How we work 

PublishPress is a Github-first company. As much as possible our code and discussions, and roadmaps are public on our Github repositories. We do ffor several reasons:

- It is good to share our work publicly.
- It produces a written record of how we are thinking about solutions.
- It enables collaboration between our team members, and allows outside contributors to collaborate with us.

# Our releases

- Releases should only happen between Monday and Thursday. We don't want to disrupt the weekeends for customers or our staff. The only exception to this release schdule is in case of an absolute emergency.
- We use Github milestones to plan releases and roadmaps.
- We do not have firm deadlines for releases. We trust our team to do good work and we don't want rushed work.

# Our plugins

- PublishPress plugins aim to solve publishing problems. Those problems revolve around content, so our plugins help you to plan, schedule, revise, manage (etc.) content on your WordPress site.
- All our plugins have one Free and one Pro version. We do not have add-ons or extensions.
- The Free and Pro versions of the plugin are always upated simultaneously and share the same version number.
- The Free version of the plugin should have all the key features needed to work out-of-the-box.

# Our team

- 30 hours of good work each week is enough. After that, the quality of our work goes down. Any extra time can be spent learning, researching, or trying new ideas.
- We don't work on weekends.
- Sometimes we have bad days, or even bad weeks or months. It happens to all of us. Don't worry, we hire for the long term. On average, our staff have been with us for over five years.
- It helps to be good at clear written communication. Can you write an accurate Github issue?
- It is not important to be good with video calls and spoken English.
- Meetings can be useful, but do not need to be held every day or even every week. What is important is clear, regular written communication and collaboration.
