# How we work at PublishPress

We are a Github-first company. As much as possible our code and discussions, and roadmaps are public on our Github repositories. We do ffor several reasons:

- It is good to share our work publicly.
- It produces a written record of how we are thinking about solutions.
- It enables collaboration between our team members, and allows outside contributors to collaborate with us.

# Our release schedule

- Releases should only happen between Monday and Thursday. We don't want to disrupt the weekeends for customers or our staff.

# Our team

- We don't work on weekends.
- 30 hours of good work each week is enough. After that, the quality of our work goes down
