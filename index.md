This site provides the guides, standards and good practices for developing PublishPress plugins.

It is important to note that this is a project in progress, and we are constantly working to improve our plugins' code in order to follow the guidelines we describe here.     

## Consistency!

That is the goal. The most important principle we are pursuing as a team.

## Who we are

Hello, we are the [PublishPress](https://publishpress.com) team. We create Professional Publishing Plugins for WordPress, and [we love Penguins](https://publishpress.com/brand/)!
