## <a name="free-and-pro-plugins"></a>Free and Pro plugins

We publish plugins in two versions: Free (available in the WordPress.org) and Pro (available for members).
The Free versions are fully functional and are not broken versions designed to sell the Pro upgrade.

The Free plugins are used as base for the Pro plugins, added to the package using Composer, as a vendor library. 

## <a name="project-management"></a>Project management and bug tracking

We use GitHub as our project management tool. Features requests or bug tracking are managed as Github issues. Both Free and Pro plugins use the Issues on the Free repositories.
